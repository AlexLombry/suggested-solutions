# Introduction to Strigo

With this introduction to Strigo, you should know how to:

 - Use the dropdown to switch nodes
 - Use the gear shift button to find out IP/public DNS info
 - Use the tabbing mechanism to make new session tabs

## Switch Nodes

1.  Using the drop down menu near the top of the page will allow you to switch nodes:

## Connection Information

1.  To the right of the drop down menu, there is a gear shift symbol. Click on it then on the `Machine Info` tab in order to get information about this node:

    Something like this will pop up:

## Creating New Sessions

1.  In some exercises, you will need to have a second connection session for one node. To create another connection session, you will need to click on the `+` button to the right of the current opened tab:

    ![""](../primers/images/screen-session-tab.png)/

    You will now see two tabs connected to the same node:

    You can make more if necessary.
